<p><a NAME="Install_Configuring"></a><b><font size=+1>Configuring Netscape
Address Book Sync</font></b>
<p>You can use the "Customize..." feature of the HotSync manager to configure
the Netscape Address Book Sync to synchronize, copy the Netscape Address
Books to the Palm organizer, or do nothing.&nbsp; By default, the Netscape
Address Book Sync is set to synchronize data between your Palm organizer
and Netscape address books.&nbsp; It is also possible to manually configure
Netscape Address Book Sync to ignore specific Netscape address books.&nbsp;
This is done by editing the nabcnd32.cfg file.&nbsp; This file can be found
in the same directory as netscape.exe and is in the format of a standard
Windows .ini file.&nbsp; To exclude specific address books from being synchronized
with the Palm organizer, edit the [SyncExclude] section and add a line
for each address book you wish to exclude.&nbsp; For instance, to exclude
the address books "Top Secret" and "Old Addresses" the nabcnd32.cfg file
should contain:
<br>[SyncExclude]
<br>1=Top Secret
<br>2=Old Addresses
<p>By default, Netscape Address Book Sync attempts to synchronize all Netscape
address books.
<p><a NAME="Install_PrepareNS"></a><b><font size=+1>Preparing Netscape
address books for Sync</font></b>
<p>Personal address books do not need any preparation.&nbsp; To synchronize
LDAP directories you must make sure you have configured them for "Offline"
access.&nbsp; To do this, select the directory you want to sychronize,
display the properties for that directory, select the Offline Settings
tab, and check "Select this Directory for download".
<br>&nbsp;</div>

<div CLASS="Heading1"><a NAME="Install_Synchro"></a><b><font size=+1>Synchronizing
your palm organizer for the first time</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Is your Palm organizer address book empty?</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Follow the instructions for your Palm organizer and synchronize.&nbsp;
Your organizer address book will then contain all of the records from your
Netscape address books.&nbsp; Each Netscape address book will be a category
on the Palm organizer.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Is your Netscape Communicator address book empty?</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
After sychronizing, all "Unfiled" records will be filed in a category.&nbsp;
This is due to the mapping of categories to Netscape address books.&nbsp;
By default, Unfiled records will get added to the "Personal Address Book"
in Communicator and filed in the "Personal" category on the Palm organizer.&nbsp;
If you do not want these records to get filed in the "Personal" category
then you will need to manually file them before sychronizing.</li>

<li>
Follow the instructions for your Palm organizer and synchronize.&nbsp;
Your Netscape Communicator address book will then contain all of the records
from your Palm organizer.&nbsp; An address book will be created for each
category on the organizer.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Do you have records in your organizer and in your Netscape Communicator
address books?</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Categories &amp; address books</li>

<ul>
<li>
Netscape Address Book Sync will only attempt to synchronize the first 15
address books due to the Palm organizer limit of 15 categories.&nbsp; Before
you synchronize you need to make sure that the total number of categories
+ the total number of Netscape address books you want to synchronize does
not exceed 15.&nbsp; Categories with the same name as Netscape address
books will be merged and you should only count them once.</li>

<li>
A common problem is that all 15 categories on the Palm organizer are used
and when you synchronize there's not any room to add the Netscape address
books.&nbsp; You can fix this by either removing categories from your Palm
organizer or by making sure that the Netscape address books you want to
synchronize are named the same as an existing category on the Palm organizer
so that they get merged.</li>
</ul>

<li>
After sychronizing, all "Unfiled" Palm organizer records will be filed
in a category.&nbsp; This is due to the mapping of categories to Netscape
address books.&nbsp; By default, Unfiled records will get added to the
"Personal Address Book" in Communicator and filed in the "Personal" category
on the Palm organizer.&nbsp; If you do not want these records to get filed
in the "Personal" category then you will need to manually file them before
sychronizing.</li>

<li>
Be aware that records that exist in a category and in a Netscape address
book with the same name will get duplicated.&nbsp; The most common occurrence
of this is records in your Netscape Personal Address Book and in your Palm
"Personal" category.&nbsp; It is your choice whether to avoid this before
synchronizing by deleting/refiling&nbsp; records, or to clean up duplicate
records after the synchronization.</li>

<li>
If you have an offlined LDAP directory that has the same name as a Palm
organizer category, all of the Palm records in that category will get re-filed
in the "Personal" category and added to the Netscape Personal Address Book.&nbsp;
To avoid this, rename the category on the Palm so that it is different
from the LDAP directory name.</li>

<li>
Follow the instructions for your Palm organizer and synchronize.&nbsp;
All records on the Palm organizer will be copied to Netscape Communicator
and all Netscape Communicator records will get copied to the Palm organizer.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</div>

<div CLASS="Heading1">&nbsp;</div>

<div CLASS="Heading1"><a NAME="Install_Limits"></a><b><font size=+1>Limitations</font></b></div>

<ul>
<li>
LDAP directories that are not offlined cannot be synchronized.</li>

<li>
A maximum of 15 address books will be synchronized.</li>

<li>
All Netscape fields with the exception of the Notes and Address fields
cannot contain multiple lines.&nbsp; When synchronizing, field values on
the organizer that contain multiple lines will be changed to single line
entries with each line separated by ", ".</li>
</ul>
<a NAME="Install_Profiles"></a><b><font size=+1>Synchronizing with Different
Netscape User Profiles</font></b>
<p>Once you have successfully synchronized using a specific User Profile,
there are 2 choices for synchronization when you change to a different
User Profile.&nbsp; You will be given a choice during sync to decide which
type of synchronization you desire.&nbsp; You may choose to synchronize
with the new profile and merge all of the Pilot records with the Netscape
address books in the new profile - this employs the same logic as <a href="#Install_Synchro">Synchronizing
your palm organizer for the first time</a>.&nbsp; If you have existing
records in your new profile, this may cause duplicate records which you
will have to manually delete.&nbsp; The second choice is to copy the new
profile to the Pilot.&nbsp; This will ERASE ALL records from the Pilot
device and copy the address books from the new user profile to the Pilot.

<ul>
<li>
Make sure your PC's HotSync Manager (Start > Programs > Palm Desktop >
HotSync Manager) is on.</li>

<li>
Make sure that Netscape Address Book Sync is installed. You can verify
this by selecting "Customize..." from the HotSync Manager menu or by running
NSABPPIN.exe.</li>

<li>
Close all HotSync windows on your PC (e.g. HotSync Log, Custom menu).</li>

<li>
Verify that your palm organizer is placed properly in its cradle.</li>

<li>
Make sure the Netscape Address Book HotSync Custom settings are not set
to Do Nothing.</li>

<li>
Verify the Serial Port settings using the Setup dialog box (opened when
you click the HotSync manager icon on your PC's Taskbar and choose Setup).
